data.}
\usage{
\method{LOOCV}{array}(
  data,
  grps,
  f,
  method,
  maxvars,
  VStep,
  lev = 0,
  features = c("Var", "Cor", "IQR", "PE", "DM"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Sample from the population (dim x length x cases)}

\item{grps}{Labeled vector that classify the observations}

\item{f}{Selected filter for the MODWT (to see the available filters use the
function \code{\link{availableFilters}}}

\item{method}{Selected method for the discriminant.
Valid values "linear" "quadratic"}

\item{maxvars}{Maximum number of variables included by the StepDiscrim
algorithm (Note that if you defined this, can not define VStep).
Must be a positive integer greater than 0.}

\item{VStep}{Minimum value of V above which all other variables are
considered irrelevant and therefore will not be included. (Note that
if you defined this, can not defined maxvars). Must be a positive
number and greater than 0. For more information see StepDiscrim
documentation}

\item{lev}{Determines the number of decomposition levels for MODWT
(by default the optimum is calculated using the "conservative"
strategy). Must be a positive integer (including 0 to auto-select
the level)}

\item{features}{A list of characteristics that will be used for the
classification process. To see the available features see
\code{\link{availableFeatures}}}

\item{returnClassification}{Allows to select if the raw result classification
is returned.}

\item{nCores}{Determines the number of processes that will be used in the
function, by default it uses all but one of the system cores. Must be
a positive integer, where 0 corresponds to the default behavior.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item if returnClassification is false return a object of class
confusionMatrix
\item if returnClassification is true, it returns a list containing an
object of the confusionMatrix class and a vector with the
classification result.
}
}
\description{
It generates and validates a discriminant model starting from the data.
First, a WaveAnalysis object is obtained according to the selected
characteristics, filter and levels. Then, the most important features are
selected using a stepwise discriminant that allows to select a maximum number
of variables (maxvars) or a minimum enhancement step (VStep). Finally, the
model is trained using the subset of features and validated using
Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV).
